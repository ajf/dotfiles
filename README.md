ajf's dotfiles
==============

These are my dotfiles, they are based on [yadm](https://yadm.io).  I work on Darwin, Arch, OpenBSD, and occasionally Debian.

I use:

* Alacritty terminal
* Neovim 0.9x w/Lazy.nvim
* Tmux
* Homebrew (darwin)
* Fish (w/oh-my-fish)
* i3 when I have a WM
* TaskWarrior

Using these:

* install yadm
* yadm clone https://github.com/ajf/dotfiles.git
* yadm bootstrap

PRs welcome for more rust things, and more compatibility with other OSes, and awesome neovim stuff.
